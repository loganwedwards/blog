Knowing that our camera (along with other professional cameras in Canon&#8217;s lineup) has a lens micro adjustment feature, I decided to give it a spin. Wow, what a difference in sharpness. I set the camera on a tripod a few feet away from the subject (can&#8217;t remember the exposure settings) and snapped a few shots at different adjustment factors. You can search for the details on how this works elsewhere; I just wanted to share the results.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.le-create.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/plus5crop.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-89\" title=\"Before MA\" src=\"http:\/\/www.le-create.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/plus5crop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Before adjustment<\/p><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_90\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.le-create.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/plus12crop.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-90\" title=\"After MA\" src=\"http:\/\/www.le-create.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/plus12crop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">After adjustment<\/p><\/div>\n<p>So, there is still some room for improvement, but the increase in sharpness here was enough to appease my wife&#8217;s critical eye.<\/p>\n<p>Now that the lens has been dropped on the pavement, it was time to upgrade&#8230; to the f\/1.2 version.<\/p>\n<p>Bottom line: use this feature for every lens that you own.

It\u2019s fairly simple. Three files serves up everything I need for a simple timer (a few more added so it could be published as a packaged app in the Chrome Web Store). I feel that I have followed the MVC design intent fairly well with a HTML file (for content organization), a CSS file (for beautification and some animation) and a Javascript file to handle the timer functionality. I learned quite a bit and the saying that I\u2019m used to at my day job still applies: nothing is rarely ever as simple as it seems. Let me explain. I had to figure out and overcome some default behaviors for styling as well as how to implement my own timing function. I\u2019m sure there is a library somewhere, but no better way to learn than to implement it yourself. I did find some great resources, which will be posted at the bottom.\n\n**HTML**\n\nThe markup is short and sweet. Keep in mind that all of the imagery is pure HTML and CSS; no images were uploaded. I basically set a bunch of `div` elements up to arrange the second hand, the clock face and the control labels.\n\n**CSS**\n\nThis was fun. I\u2019ve used the `transition` and `transform` properties before, but combining this with `keyframes` opens up interesting animation possibilities.\n\nTo animate the hand, a JQuery selector adds this class:\n\n```\n.animation {\nanimation: orbit 60s steps(360) infinite;\n-webkit-animation: orbit 60s steps(360) infinite;\nanimation-duration: 60s;\n-webkit-animation-duration: 60s;\n}\n```\n\nI created an animation property called orbit. I directly prescribed the animation conditions at 0, 50 and 100% of the animation:\n\n```\n@-webkit-keyframes orbit {\n0% {\n-webkit-transform: rotate(180deg);\n-webkit-transform-origin:top;\ntransform: rotate(180deg);\ntransform-origin:top;\n}\n50% {\n-webkit-transform: rotate(360deg);\n-webkit-transform-origin:top;\ntransform: rotate(360deg);\ntransform-origin:top;\n}\n100% {\n-webkit-transform: rotate(540deg);\n-webkit-transform-origin:top;\ntransform: rotate(540deg);\ntransform-origin:top;\n}\n}\n```\n\n**Javascript (JQuery)**  \n I used JQuery to speed up development time and let me focus on the fun stuff: the timing! Since calculating times can be a bit tricky since I want the screen to continually update the elapsed time, since you know, I\u2019m making a timer application! I accomplished this with the built-in `setInterval()` function. I feel that it is called often enough for a simple timer app (10 times \/ second). The interesting part on how the timing works is below. Note: Some variables were defined outside of the scope shown below. The main takeaway was how to deal with pausing and resuming the timer: a global variable `$prevTime` was used to store the total elapsed time, which was added to the current timer. Note: On the output, there should be a `p` wrapped around the `formatTime($totalTime)` call\u2026 something strange with WordPress\u2019 text editor removing these.\n\n```\n$(\"#start\").click(function () {\n\nif(!$running){\n$running = true; \/\/ Ensure that we can't start a 2nd concurrent timer\n\n$start = new Date().getTime();\n\n$doTime = window.setInterval(function() {clock($prevTime);},100);\n\n\/**\n* Run this function on setInterval to continuously update\n* the time shown on the page.\n*\/\nfunction clock($p) {\n$prevTime = $p; \/\/ pass in the previous time\n$time = (new Date().getTime() - $start); \/\/ start calculating\n\n$time = ($time \/ 100) \/ 10;\n$time += parseFloat($prevTime); \/\/ add previously elapsed time\n\n$totalTime = ($time).toFixed(2); \/\/ set to 2 decimals\n$(\"#time\").html(\"<span>\" + formatTime($totalTime) + \"<\/span>\");\n}\n```\n\nI implemented a simple version of a `printf`-like function for the time format.\n\n```\nfunction formatTime($tIn) {\nvar $hr, $min, $sec;\nvar $t = $tIn;\nvar $out = \"\";\n$hr = Math.floor($t \/ 3600); \/\/ hold the hours\n$t -= $hr * 3600; \/\/ update the time var\n$min = Math.floor($t \/ 60); \/\/ hold the minutes\n$t -= $min * 60; \/\/ update the time var\n$sec = $t.toFixed(2); \/\/ assign the seconds\n\n\/**\n* Some basic formatting for the output.\n* Note this is a string and is not the\n* number used for any time calculations.\n*\/\n$out = $hr + \":\" + $min + \":\" + $sec;\nreturn $out;\n};\n```\n\nThe code is hosted on my [Github account](https:\/\/github.com\/loganwedwards\/HTML-Timer \"Github\").\n\n\n","html":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.le-create.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/Clock-Promo-Med.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-155\" alt=\"Timer App Promo Image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.le-create.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/Clock-Promo-Med.jpg\" width=\"920\" height=\"680\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I spent the weekend cooking up a <a title=\"Web app\" href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/timer\/keajpdeigjicancnhaknebefgekooiof?hl=en-US\" target=\"_blank\">web app<\/a>. It&#8217;s fairly simple. Three files serves up everything I need for a simple timer (a few more added so it could be published as a packaged app in the Chrome Web Store). I feel that I have followed the MVC design intent fairly well with a HTML file (for content organization), a CSS file (for beautification and some animation) and a Javascript file to handle the timer functionality. I learned quite a bit and the saying that I&#8217;m used to at my day job still applies: nothing is rarely ever as simple as it seems. Let me explain. I had to figure out and overcome some default behaviors for styling as well as how to implement my own timing function. I&#8217;m sure there is a library somewhere, but no better way to learn than to implement it yourself.

With mobile UX paradigms making their way into every aspect of our lives, I had to rethink the original approach on how to show or hide content when the user\u2019s interactions are required.

Create a directive to throw on an element that will be interacted with\n2. (Optional) Add a class to child elements where you want to prevent the default close behavior.

This is what listens to our click and inverts the the watchValue that we defined. The controller function takes care of listening for clicks on the document as a whole and if the menu or object is open (or truthy), then, let\u2019s go ahead and close\/hide the element.\n\nUsage in the view\n\n<div close-on-click watch-value=\"showStuff\"> <div ng-show=\"showStuff\"> <h1>Cool hidden stuff<\/h1> <\/div> <\/div>\n\nThat\u2019s it!
