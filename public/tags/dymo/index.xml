Dymo label maker opened up with replacement lever partially installed
Work recently had a cleanout day to get rid of clutter in our office area; a late spring-clean, if you will. I&amp;#8217;m always on the hunt for working (or not in this case) gadgets for spares or to re-purpose. I came across a Dymo 210D label maker. The electronics function just fine and there were quite a few extra unused cartridges as well. The only problem was that I kept getting a &lt;em&gt;tape jam&lt;/em&gt; error when trying to print. After reading through Dymo&amp;#8217;s troubleshooting literature, which had little value in this case, I disassembled the unit and found the culprit: a small section of a lever arm (for lack of a better term here) broke where a spring should be connected. Sounds suspect to me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excited that I just acquired a new 3d printer, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://store.solidoodle.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;amp;product_id=56&#34; title=&#34;Solidoodle&#34;&gt;Solidoodle Gen 2&lt;/a&gt; with the heated bed (a must for ABS prints), I decided to use my new wonder-machine for fix this printer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the part was completed, I compared it with the original. By doing no tuning or adjustments on the 3d printer, I&amp;#8217;m pretty happy with the outcome. Of course, I had to print rafts to support the small overhang, so there are some squirrely print layers at that location and the inner holes came out about .020&amp;#8243; undersize, but overall, I&amp;#8217;m happy! I just had one issue: I modeled the part wrong. As an engineer, it&amp;#8217;s always important to validate your assumptions and double and triple check everything. Here&amp;#8217;s a good example of what happens when you don&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;

Drill bits were used to clean up the internal thru holes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the quick fix and another 10 minute print, I was in business. I used some drill bits to clean up the internal holes and installed the part.&lt;/p&gt;

The working unit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assembled the unit and voila! My new printer fixed an old one. It was a great experience with: fixing something, using a 3d printer, applying engineering to home use and learning how simple label makers are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daily inspiration from fixing and repairing is hanging on my cubicle wall at work: Sugru&amp;#8217;s Fixer&amp;#8217;s Manifesto seen below.&lt;/p&gt;
