      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently picked up an unlocked 32GB Nexus 6 and have been using it for about a month. Besides the initial shock of the monstrously large screen (which I&amp;#8217;m actually loving now), I&amp;#8217;ve found this as a nice upgrade from my Nexus 4 (which sadly is on its 3rd screen and has many cracks). Unfortunately, being the klutz that I am, my phone fell out of my pocket when sitting and now the Nexus 6 has a small crack as well. That&amp;#8217;s a story for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I wanted to share a quick clip showing the painless process of transferring settings and apps from your old device to a new device. NFC is required on both devices for this to function and I believe the destination device has to be running Android 5.0. I had my Nexus 4 running the stock 5.0 image from their site as well.&lt;/p&gt;
