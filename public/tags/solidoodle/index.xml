      <description>

&lt;p&gt;For my second project utilizing the 3d printer, a Solidoodle, I wanted to design something from the ground up to solve a problem: find a way to better secure the iPad Mini in the car to appease the baby&amp;#8217;s senses, i.e., keep the iPad hanging up so we can get his fill of &amp;#8216;Baby Einsteins&amp;#8217; on a long car trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;concept-1-corner-brackets:d560f0219f8513849d0b9b0c4bfb5c36&#34;&gt;Concept 1: Corner Brackets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first design utilized corner clamps held together by pressing aluminum rods into blind holes. The objectives of this design were to minimize the material noticed by the user and be rigid. The aluminum rods also have the added benefit of attaching auxiliary parts anywhere along their length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2013/10/Assem1-front-1024x560.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Overview&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2013/10/Assem1-With-Hooks.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;1st iteration&#34; /&gt;
1st design: corner brackets, aluminum rod and hooks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the design was aesthetically pleasing from the front, I discovered two issues that made me rethink my strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The press fit of the aluminum rods would eventually wear out the holes in the printed parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assembly/disassembly would take a few seconds to line everything up and would most likely end up in a frustrated mess on the floor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the final print of the assembly. Sometimes you have to hold and interact with an object before iterating again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2013/10/ipad-mini-1st-design.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Final Print&#34; /&gt;
1st design: Final print&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;design-2-snap-on-bracket-with-kickstand:d560f0219f8513849d0b9b0c4bfb5c36&#34;&gt;Design 2: Snap-on Bracket with Kickstand&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unhappy with the result of the first design, I took the suggestion from a colleague to just use a single piece to wrap around the edges. From there I tweaked the design to give a snug, but not overly tight (my wife may still disagree on this point) fit to the iPad. I reused some of the aluminum rod ordered for the first design and used it as a pin to attach the hook/kickstand part. After a few trials getting the Solidoodle to give me non-warping prints, which I&amp;#8217;ll cover another day (and tweaking the design by tenths of mm&amp;#8217;s), I finally had a good working solution. Below is a gallery of the CAD model, final product and some use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

2nd Design: Shown using the kickstand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was another great learning opportunity in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;industrial design: I have some aesthetic and finishing changes I would like to make&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mechanical design: clamping force and tolerancing for 3D printing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user feedback: make sure the wife and baby are pleased users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3D Printing nuances: warping, thermal contraction, tolerances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, on to find more problems to solve (and taking a relaxing drive knowing the baby is content with his visual educational material).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improving Solidoodle Prints</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2013/09/improving-solidoodle-prints/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2013/09/improving-solidoodle-prints/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I begin to explain &lt;em&gt;3D printing&lt;/em&gt; to some of my colleagues, their jaw migrates to the agape position while:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are learning about a new technology that is almost magical and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are already figuring out how to use this wonder technology to solve some problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case in point: a colleague asked about printing a replacement part for a RC car, but modifying and repurposing it for a completely different application. I recieved the part, discussed how we could modify it for his needs, measured, modeled and began to print.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then small disasters struck! The piece is flat, which I thought would have given me great adhesion to the build platform, but I obviously had not tested this theory on parts with larger than a 1cm² footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have some warping problems (no, not the kind that Starship Enterprise did in the latest movie). See below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2013/09/3D-printer-stuff-2738.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;3d Parts&#34; /&gt;
Prints after various tweaks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the steps I took between each print, until I finally was happy with the output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first print became detached from the base since all of the corners started warping and tracking upwards. I believe since so little surface area was contacting the build platform, it just spun out of control when the nozzle was close at a certain point. Some old gooey filament on the side of the nozzle may have also contacted the part as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean the nozzle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part finished, but the warping issue still persisted. To the Solidoodle forums I go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raise the heated bed temperature to 100°C and fine-tuned the level of the platform according to Solidoodle&amp;#8217;s website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third print did much better, although I was still not happy with the continuing warpage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raise the heated bed temperature to 103°C (this was definitely scientifically chosen as a precise temperature&amp;#8230; although this thread speaks of 100°C being a magic number). I also asked my wife for some hairspray. Apparently this stuff was engineered to make ABS parts really stick to the platform and as a side benefit also nicely styles hairdos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final part came out really nice. There is a minute amount of warping on one corner (less than .3mm or 1 layer). The bottom part in the photo above shows the final print.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For parts with more than a few cm² surface area contact with the bed, this is a must. I&amp;#8217;ve read that with some tuning out of the box, this machine can really do some amazing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
