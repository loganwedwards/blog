      <title>Bracket and Stand for the iPad Mini</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;For my second project utilizing the 3d printer, a Solidoodle, I wanted to design something from the ground up to solve a problem: find a way to better secure the iPad Mini in the car to appease the baby&amp;#8217;s senses, i.e., keep the iPad hanging up so we can get his fill of &amp;#8216;Baby Einsteins&amp;#8217; on a long car trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;concept-1-corner-brackets:d560f0219f8513849d0b9b0c4bfb5c36&#34;&gt;Concept 1: Corner Brackets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first design utilized corner clamps held together by pressing aluminum rods into blind holes. The objectives of this design were to minimize the material noticed by the user and be rigid. The aluminum rods also have the added benefit of attaching auxiliary parts anywhere along their length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/blog/img/2013/10/Assem1-front-1024x560.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Overview&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/blog/img/2013/10/Assem1-With-Hooks.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;1st iteration&#34; /&gt;
1st design: corner brackets, aluminum rod and hooks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the design was aesthetically pleasing from the front, I discovered two issues that made me rethink my strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The press fit of the aluminum rods would eventually wear out the holes in the printed parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assembly/disassembly would take a few seconds to line everything up and would most likely end up in a frustrated mess on the floor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the final print of the assembly. Sometimes you have to hold and interact with an object before iterating again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/blog/img/2013/10/ipad-mini-1st-design.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Final Print&#34; /&gt;
1st design: Final print&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;design-2-snap-on-bracket-with-kickstand:d560f0219f8513849d0b9b0c4bfb5c36&#34;&gt;Design 2: Snap-on Bracket with Kickstand&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unhappy with the result of the first design, I took the suggestion from a colleague to just use a single piece to wrap around the edges. From there I tweaked the design to give a snug, but not overly tight (my wife may still disagree on this point) fit to the iPad. I reused some of the aluminum rod ordered for the first design and used it as a pin to attach the hook/kickstand part. After a few trials getting the Solidoodle to give me non-warping prints, which I&amp;#8217;ll cover another day (and tweaking the design by tenths of mm&amp;#8217;s), I finally had a good working solution. Below is a gallery of the CAD model, final product and some use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

2nd design (rear): &amp;#8216;Unibody&amp;#8217; clamp with pivoting hook&lt;/p&gt;

2nd Design: Shown using the kickstand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was another great learning opportunity in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;industrial design: I have some aesthetic and finishing changes I would like to make&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mechanical design: clamping force and tolerancing for 3D printing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user feedback: make sure the wife and baby are pleased users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3D Printing nuances: warping, thermal contraction, tolerances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, on to find more problems to solve (and taking a relaxing drive knowing the baby is content with his visual educational material).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Desk Clock Rendering</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2012/02/desk-clock-rendering/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was fascinated by a post by Google&amp;#8217;s SketchUp blog, which announced a contest based on rendering scenes with Maxwell rendering software. There are many free/paid solutions, but out of the few that I tried, the free version of Maxwell seems to offer the least amount of fuss as far as installation and setup. The full version is only $99, so it&amp;#8217;s a steal compared to some of the other professional solutions available. Here is my first attempt at rendering [this][1].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I still have very little idea of what 90% of the settings are actually for. One day I plan to dig deep into the documentation to learn what I am actually manipulating.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I use SolidWorks at my workplace for 3D modeling. It is intuitive, powerful and extremely expensive. I can&amp;#8217;t quite justify the use of a multi-thousand dollar license for personal use. Hence, I&amp;rsquo;ve used Google SketchUp for hobby modeling. One day, I may spring for the professional version, and at $500, it is a steal compared to a basic seat of SolidWorks. From time to time, I will share some of my designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is desk clock that I modeled:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/blog/img/2012/02/alarm-clock1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Desk Clock&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opted for an aluminum finish with a basic monochrome LCD display projecting on a glass surface. For a minimalist appearance, I chose to use two buttons, one for the hour and the other for minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
