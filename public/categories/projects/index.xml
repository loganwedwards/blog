      <title>Bracket and Stand for the iPad Mini</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;For my second project utilizing the 3d printer, a Solidoodle, I wanted to design something from the ground up to solve a problem: find a way to better secure the iPad Mini in the car to appease the baby&amp;#8217;s senses, i.e., keep the iPad hanging up so we can get his fill of &amp;#8216;Baby Einsteins&amp;#8217; on a long car trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;concept-1-corner-brackets:d560f0219f8513849d0b9b0c4bfb5c36&#34;&gt;Concept 1: Corner Brackets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first design utilized corner clamps held together by pressing aluminum rods into blind holes. The objectives of this design were to minimize the material noticed by the user and be rigid. The aluminum rods also have the added benefit of attaching auxiliary parts anywhere along their length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2013/10/Assem1-front-1024x560.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Overview&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2013/10/Assem1-With-Hooks.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;1st iteration&#34; /&gt;
1st design: corner brackets, aluminum rod and hooks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the design was aesthetically pleasing from the front, I discovered two issues that made me rethink my strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The press fit of the aluminum rods would eventually wear out the holes in the printed parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assembly/disassembly would take a few seconds to line everything up and would most likely end up in a frustrated mess on the floor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the final print of the assembly. Sometimes you have to hold and interact with an object before iterating again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2013/10/ipad-mini-1st-design.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Final Print&#34; /&gt;
1st design: Final print&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;design-2-snap-on-bracket-with-kickstand:d560f0219f8513849d0b9b0c4bfb5c36&#34;&gt;Design 2: Snap-on Bracket with Kickstand&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unhappy with the result of the first design, I took the suggestion from a colleague to just use a single piece to wrap around the edges. From there I tweaked the design to give a snug, but not overly tight (my wife may still disagree on this point) fit to the iPad. I reused some of the aluminum rod ordered for the first design and used it as a pin to attach the hook/kickstand part. After a few trials getting the Solidoodle to give me non-warping prints, which I&amp;#8217;ll cover another day (and tweaking the design by tenths of mm&amp;#8217;s), I finally had a good working solution. Below is a gallery of the CAD model, final product and some use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2013/10/Assem2-2-Rear-1024x620.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Rear 1&#34; /&gt;

2nd Design: Shown using the kickstand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was another great learning opportunity in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;industrial design: I have some aesthetic and finishing changes I would like to make&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mechanical design: clamping force and tolerancing for 3D printing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user feedback: make sure the wife and baby are pleased users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3D Printing nuances: warping, thermal contraction, tolerances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, on to find more problems to solve (and taking a relaxing drive knowing the baby is content with his visual educational material).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improving Solidoodle Prints</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2013/09/improving-solidoodle-prints/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2013/09/improving-solidoodle-prints/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I begin to explain &lt;em&gt;3D printing&lt;/em&gt; to some of my colleagues, their jaw migrates to the agape position while:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are learning about a new technology that is almost magical and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are already figuring out how to use this wonder technology to solve some problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case in point: a colleague asked about printing a replacement part for a RC car, but modifying and repurposing it for a completely different application. I recieved the part, discussed how we could modify it for his needs, measured, modeled and began to print.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then small disasters struck! The piece is flat, which I thought would have given me great adhesion to the build platform, but I obviously had not tested this theory on parts with larger than a 1cm² footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have some warping problems (no, not the kind that Starship Enterprise did in the latest movie). See below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2013/09/3D-printer-stuff-2738.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;3d Parts&#34; /&gt;
Prints after various tweaks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the steps I took between each print, until I finally was happy with the output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first print became detached from the base since all of the corners started warping and tracking upwards. I believe since so little surface area was contacting the build platform, it just spun out of control when the nozzle was close at a certain point. Some old gooey filament on the side of the nozzle may have also contacted the part as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean the nozzle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part finished, but the warping issue still persisted. To the Solidoodle forums I go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raise the heated bed temperature to 100°C and fine-tuned the level of the platform according to Solidoodle&amp;#8217;s website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third print did much better, although I was still not happy with the continuing warpage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raise the heated bed temperature to 103°C (this was definitely scientifically chosen as a precise temperature&amp;#8230; although this thread speaks of 100°C being a magic number). I also asked my wife for some hairspray. Apparently this stuff was engineered to make ABS parts really stick to the platform and as a side benefit also nicely styles hairdos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final part came out really nice. There is a minute amount of warping on one corner (less than .3mm or 1 layer). The bottom part in the photo above shows the final print.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For parts with more than a few cm² surface area contact with the bed, this is a must. I&amp;#8217;ve read that with some tuning out of the box, this machine can really do some amazing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>One Printer Fixes Another</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2013/09/one-printer-fixes-another/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

Dymo label maker opened up with replacement lever partially installed
Work recently had a cleanout day to get rid of clutter in our office area; a late spring-clean, if you will. I&amp;#8217;m always on the hunt for working (or not in this case) gadgets for spares or to re-purpose. I came across a Dymo 210D label maker. The electronics function just fine and there were quite a few extra unused cartridges as well. The only problem was that I kept getting a &lt;em&gt;tape jam&lt;/em&gt; error when trying to print. After reading through Dymo&amp;#8217;s troubleshooting literature, which had little value in this case, I disassembled the unit and found the culprit: a small section of a lever arm (for lack of a better term here) broke where a spring should be connected. Sounds suspect to me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excited that I just acquired a new 3d printer, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://store.solidoodle.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;amp;product_id=56&#34; title=&#34;Solidoodle&#34;&gt;Solidoodle Gen 2&lt;/a&gt; with the heated bed (a must for ABS prints), I decided to use my new wonder-machine for fix this printer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the part was completed, I compared it with the original. By doing no tuning or adjustments on the 3d printer, I&amp;#8217;m pretty happy with the outcome. Of course, I had to print rafts to support the small overhang, so there are some squirrely print layers at that location and the inner holes came out about .020&amp;#8243; undersize, but overall, I&amp;#8217;m happy! I just had one issue: I modeled the part wrong. As an engineer, it&amp;#8217;s always important to validate your assumptions and double and triple check everything. Here&amp;#8217;s a good example of what happens when you don&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2013/09/IMG_20130912_063640.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Original&#34; /&gt;

Drill bits were used to clean up the internal thru holes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the quick fix and another 10 minute print, I was in business. I used some drill bits to clean up the internal holes and installed the part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2013/09/IMG_20130912_143019.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Working Unit&#34; /&gt;
The working unit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assembled the unit and voila! My new printer fixed an old one. It was a great experience with: fixing something, using a 3d printer, applying engineering to home use and learning how simple label makers are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daily inspiration from fixing and repairing is hanging on my cubicle wall at work: Sugru&amp;#8217;s Fixer&amp;#8217;s Manifesto seen below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Timer Web App</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2013/07/my-timer-web-app/</link>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2013/07/Clock-Promo-Med.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Hero Image&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the weekend cooking up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timer/keajpdeigjicancnhaknebefgekooiof?hl=en-US&#34;&gt;web app&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s fairly simple. Three files serves up everything I need for a simple timer (a few more added so it could be published as a packaged app in the Chrome Web Store). I feel that I have followed the MVC design intent fairly well with a HTML file (for content organization), a CSS file (for beautification and some animation) and a Javascript file to handle the timer functionality. I learned quite a bit and the saying that I&amp;#8217;m used to at my day job still applies: nothing is rarely ever as simple as it seems. Let me explain. I had to figure out and overcome some default behaviors for styling as well as how to implement my own timing function. I&amp;#8217;m sure there is a library somewhere, but no better way to learn than to implement it yourself. I did find some great resources, which will be posted at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;html:645367c7fbc3bf2fd8812011329bcb2c&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The markup is short and sweet. Keep in mind that all of the imagery is pure HTML and CSS; no images were uploaded. I basically set a bunch of &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; elements up to arrange the second hand, the clock face and the control labels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;css:645367c7fbc3bf2fd8812011329bcb2c&#34;&gt;CSS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was fun. I&amp;#8217;ve used the &lt;code&gt;transition&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;transform&lt;/code&gt; properties before, but combining this with &lt;code&gt;keyframes&lt;/code&gt; opens up interesting animation possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To animate the hand, a JQuery selector adds this class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.animation {
  animation: orbit 60s steps(360) infinite;
  -webkit-animation: orbit 60s steps(360) infinite;
  animation-duration: 60s;
  -webkit-animation-duration: 60s;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created an animation property called orbit. I directly prescribed the animation conditions at 0, 50 and 100% of the animation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@-webkit-keyframes orbit {
  0% {
    -webkit-transform: rotate(180deg);
    -webkit-transform-origin:top;
    transform: rotate(180deg);
    transform-origin:top;
  }
  50% {
    -webkit-transform: rotate(360deg);
    -webkit-transform-origin:top;
    transform: rotate(360deg);
    transform-origin:top;
  }
  100% {
    -webkit-transform: rotate(540deg);
    -webkit-transform-origin:top;
    transform: rotate(540deg);
    transform-origin:top;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;javascript-jquery:645367c7fbc3bf2fd8812011329bcb2c&#34;&gt;Javascript (JQuery)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used JQuery to speed up development time and let me focus on the fun stuff: the timing! Since calculating times can be a bit tricky since I want the screen to continually update the elapsed time, since you know, I&amp;#8217;m making a timer application! I accomplished this with the built-in &lt;code&gt;setInterval()&lt;/code&gt; function. I feel that it is called often enough for a simple timer app (10 times / second). The interesting part on how the timing works is below. Note: Some variables were defined outside of the scope shown below. The main takeaway was how to deal with pausing and resuming the timer: a global variable &lt;code&gt;$prevTime&lt;/code&gt; was used to store the total elapsed time, which was added to the current timer. Note: On the output, there should be a &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; wrapped around the &lt;code&gt;formatTime($totalTime)&lt;/code&gt; call&amp;#8230; something strange with WordPress&amp;#8217; text editor removing these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$(&amp;quot;#start&amp;quot;).click(function () {

if(!$running){
$running = true; // Ensure that we can&#39;t start a 2nd concurrent timer

$start = new Date().getTime();

$doTime = window.setInterval(function() {clock($prevTime);},100);


// Run this function on setInterval to continuously update
// the time shown on the page.


function clock($p) {
$prevTime = $p; // pass in the previous time
$time = (new Date().getTime() - $start); // start calculating

$time = ($time / 100) / 10;
$time += parseFloat($prevTime); // add previously elapsed time

$totalTime = ($time).toFixed(2); // set to 2 decimals
$(&amp;quot;#time&amp;quot;).html(&amp;quot;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&amp;quot; + formatTime($totalTime) + &amp;quot;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;quot;);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I implemented a simple version of a &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;-like function for the time format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function formatTime($tIn) {
var $hr, $min, $sec;
var $t = $tIn;
var $out = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;;
$hr = Math.floor($t / 3600); // hold the hours
$t -= $hr * 3600; // update the time var
$min = Math.floor($t / 60); // hold the minutes
$t -= $min * 60; // update the time var
$sec = $t.toFixed(2); // assign the seconds


// Some basic formatting for the output.
// Note this is a string and is not the
// number used for any time calculations.

$out = $hr + &amp;quot;:&amp;quot; + $min + &amp;quot;:&amp;quot; + $sec;
return $out;
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code is hosted on my &lt;a title=&#34;Github&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/loganwedwards/HTML-Timer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Github account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Build a Selectable Power Source [Part 1]</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2013/07/how-to-build-a-selectable-power-source-part-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: I am not an electrical engineer. Do this at your own risk!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate waste. In fact, the entire driver for this little project was because I can&amp;#8217;t stand to see batteries be needlessly consumed. Is there really a need for a motorized baby swing to run on AA&amp;#8217;s? I bet for 90% of its uses, it will be placed inside; most likely conveniently positioned right next to an outlet in a comfortable 73 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, I have not found any great tutorials on how to build a circuit that works via a portable power source such as a couple of AA&amp;#8217;s or by another means, such as using an AC/DC adaptor (wall wart).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise is simple: a switch to select one of two power sources: a battery pack or a wall plug.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Reset a PC’s Master Password</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2012/12/how-to-reset-a-pcs-master-password/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2012/12/how-to-reset-a-pcs-master-password/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I inherited a &lt;em&gt;broken&lt;/em&gt; PC, a Toshiba Satellite M305D, from family. The machine is only a few years old and still functions fine. The problem was that a password was being required after the BIOS loaded (before Windows Vista). I did not have a rescue disk and the pc would not boot off of a Windows or Live Ubuntu disk (CD or USB). I followed trails around the internet to reset the password and found that by pulling the CMOS battery off of the motherboard would reset the passworld&amp;#8230; and reset it did!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the steps that I took to reset the master password:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the battery and case components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the hard drive (and RAM, possibly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the screws from the bottom side of the laptop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove a small cover on the north side of the keyboard. Remove the respective screws and detach the ribbon cable from the motherboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the battery. ON this machine, it looked like a sealed disk with 2 leads which attached to the motherboard via plug.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to time, I waited till the next day to plug the battery back in, but 30 minutes is a good recommendation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re assemble pc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I had already formatted the hard drive since I was planning on installing Ubuntu on it. Plug in a bootable drive (make sure the BIOS boot order has USB or CDROM appear before the HDD). It worked like a charm and I wrote this post on a rescued machine destined for the trash&amp;#8230;or recycling center.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since my wife is the creative mind and chef behind Chocolate &amp;amp; Carrots, I thought it would be appropriate for a shameless plug. Head on over to &lt;a title=&#34;chocolateandcarrots.com&#34; href=&#34;http://chocolateandcarrots.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;chocolateandcarrots.com&lt;/a&gt; for recipes and pictures of our dog (we&amp;#8217;re weird, I know).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I posted a tutorial on making  DIY chalkboard with a magnetic back. This falls under a &amp;#8216;hack,&amp;#8217; since I just repurposed a magnetic dry-erase board for my wife&amp;#8217;s needs. Check it out &lt;a title=&#34;here&#34; href=&#34;http://chocolateandcarrots.com/2011/10/how-to-make-a-magnetic-chalkboard&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
