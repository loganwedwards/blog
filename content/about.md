This site serves more or less as a diary of my learnings and topics that generally interest me. Very little time gets devoted here, so if you are reading and want to engage (and I'd love to chat), find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/loganwedwards).

There's a great chance that much of the content here may not relate as I have interests such as: aerial photography, industrial design, microcontrollers and IoT, software development, [making](http://makezine.com/2013/01/28/what-is-making/), [heavy metal covers of movie tunes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE0ukoL7sW8), 3d printing and so on.

Professionally, I started my career as a mechanical engineer (ok, technically an Engineer in Training, EIT) designing and optimizing manufacturing equipment and processes in the nuclear industry. Being a geek and wanting a shorter iteration cycle for building and delivering products, I made a career step into software development, but not too hastily to forget the attributes of mechanical engineering that I love (actual engineering principles, 3d modeling and design, mechatronic interfacing, prototyping and desktop manufacturing). I worked for 1.5 years with a connected-car startup and learned a tremendous amount about the industry and made some near and dear friends who would eventually become my new business partners. Having the right level of mojo, four of us started [Fount](http://www.fountstudio.com), a digital product design and development collective. Fount focuses on building digital (I'd love to include physical one day) assets for our clients and build meaningful relationships with them.

I'm very blessed to have a wonderful family surrounding me: a wife beyond reproach and 2 beautiful children, not to mention my immediate family and inlaws.

Thanks for stopping by and I hope you find something positive to takeaway here.
