  Sounds and vibration travels in thisÂ <em>new</em> house that we are in. It was built in the 50&#8217;s and has &#8216;aged&#8217; wood flooring throughout. Whenever I&#8217;d walk through the house, I could hear this antique&#8217;s handles clanking away. I mean, I don&#8217;t stomp around the house by any means! A quick fix with Sugru now dampens the oscillating handles and is now noise-free!
