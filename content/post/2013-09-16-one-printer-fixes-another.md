Dymo label maker opened up with replacement lever partially installed
Work recently had a cleanout day to get rid of clutter in our office area; a late spring-clean, if you will. I&#8217;m always on the hunt for working (or not in this case) gadgets for spares or to re-purpose. I came across a Dymo 210D label maker. The electronics function just fine and there were quite a few extra unused cartridges as well. The only problem was that I kept getting a _tape jam_ error when trying to print. After reading through Dymo&#8217;s troubleshooting literature, which had little value in this case, I disassembled the unit and found the culprit: a small section of a lever arm (for lack of a better term here) broke where a spring should be connected. Sounds suspect to me!

Excited that I just acquired a new 3d printer, a [Solidoodle Gen 2][1] with the heated bed (a must for ABS prints), I decided to use my new wonder-machine for fix this printer.

After the part was completed, I compared it with the original. By doing no tuning or adjustments on the 3d printer, I&#8217;m pretty happy with the outcome. Of course, I had to print rafts to support the small overhang, so there are some squirrely print layers at that location and the inner holes came out about .020&#8243; undersize, but overall, I&#8217;m happy! I just had one issue: I modeled the part wrong. As an engineer, it&#8217;s always important to validate your assumptions and double and triple check everything. Here&#8217;s a good example of what happens when you don&#8217;t.

Drill bits were used to clean up the internal thru holes

After the quick fix and another 10 minute print, I was in business. I used some drill bits to clean up the internal holes and installed the part.

The working unit!

I assembled the unit and voila! My new printer fixed an old one. It was a great experience with: fixing something, using a 3d printer, applying engineering to home use and learning how simple label makers are.

My daily inspiration from fixing and repairing is hanging on my cubicle wall at work: Sugru&#8217;s Fixer&#8217;s Manifesto seen below.
