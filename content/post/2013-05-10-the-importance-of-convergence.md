I&#8217;m sure that you&#8217;ve heard of silos. No, not the kind that house [ICBMs][1], but the idea of compartmentalizing different groups/specialties to work independently. Partly due to the company&#8217;s culture and and the industry that I used to work in (nuclear energy), there is this idea that you are only as qualified as the title or degree that you hold. I can&#8217;t change a sensor without having my hand held. It&#8217;s bull and I don&#8217;t buy it. I am a mechanical engineer by degree. I also: code, understand sparks in wires, know too many technical computer terms, know the 180° shutter rule and keyframing, play the guitar, design [websites](http://chocolateandcarrots.com), understand the difference between a slab and serif typeface and know how to cook. The point is that no one person, in my opinion, should be defined by their title, degree or singular skill. I&#8217;m currently pursuing a master&#8217;s degree in computer science. Why? I love to learn, I&#8217;m a geek and would love to find a meaningful way to find a convergence point between the physical and the abstract worlds. Maybe I will continue to design automation equipment and find a way to program [PLCs][3] and microcontrollers. Maybe I will help develop software that takes advantage of some hardware component ([internet of things][4] comes to mind). Maybe I could be a Mythbusters host! It doesn&#8217;t matter. Breadth of understanding in more important than depth. Naïve or common knowledge can lead to a deeper understanding.
