This is the first post for Le Create, a site where I document projects, hacks and tips that I&#8217;ve found to be useful. I share them for the purpose of aiding someone else who may have been in the same position. I have no vision as to what my focus will be, but I&#8217;m sure that will develop down the road. My current foci will deal with home projects, programming, mechanical design, electrical projects and maybe some photography thrown in for fun.

The site name spawned from my initials (LE for Logan Edwards) and the desire to make, modify and create. I&#8217;m interested in the physical, digital and abstract.

Get to know me. I have posted links to my various cyber-social profiles on the web (see [le-create.com][1]).
