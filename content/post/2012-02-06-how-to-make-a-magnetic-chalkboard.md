Since my wife is the creative mind and chef behind Chocolate & Carrots, I thought it would be appropriate for a shameless plug. Head on over to <a title="chocolateandcarrots.com" href="http://chocolateandcarrots.com" target="_blank">chocolateandcarrots.com</a> for recipes and pictures of our dog (we&#8217;re weird, I know).

I posted a tutorial on making  DIY chalkboard with a magnetic back. This falls under a &#8216;hack,&#8217; since I just repurposed a magnetic dry-erase board for my wife&#8217;s needs.
