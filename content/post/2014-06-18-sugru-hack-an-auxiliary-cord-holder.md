Sugru is an interesting piece of _tech_. I give away packs to friends and coworkers in hopes that they&#8217;ll find interesting uses for the stuff as I have. Here, I solved a nagging problem that I have in the car. When I finish listening to music via the auxiliary jack, I tend to drop it on the floor. This solution ensures that I do not have to dig around for the cable the next time I want to enjoy some tunes in the car.
