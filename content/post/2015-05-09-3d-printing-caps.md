I love how a 3d printer (or more accurately any rapid prototyper) can enable the production of a physical widget from a digital model in no time at all.

I recently installed some spring-loaded wheels on our barn-style gates. They have helped tremendously in keeping the latch aligned (those doors are quite heavy). After installing the wheels, I noticed the vertical mounting rod was left open to the elements, so I quickly whipped up a small cap to cover the gap. It&#8217;s the small things.
