I use SolidWorks at my workplace for 3D modeling. It is intuitive, powerful and extremely expensive. I can&#8217;t quite justify the use of a multi-thousand dollar license for personal use. Hence, I've used Google SketchUp for hobby modeling. One day, I may spring for the professional version, and at $500, it is a steal compared to a basic seat of SolidWorks. From time to time, I will share some of my designs.

Here is desk clock that I modeled:

I opted for an aluminum finish with a basic monochrome LCD display projecting on a glass surface. For a minimalist appearance, I chose to use two buttons, one for the hour and the other for minutes.
