Until recently, we had a great lens for the 7D: the Canon 50mm f/1.4 USM lens. My wife and I bought this lens with a 7D body to start out our kit. She loves the focal length for her food photography, which you can see over at [Chocolate & Carrots](http://chocolateandcarrots.com/blog). When we first started to use the lens, we were a bit bummed on the sharpness results. Knowing that our camera (along with other professional cameras in Canon&#8217;s lineup) has a lens micro adjustment feature, I decided to give it a spin. Wow, what a difference in sharpness. I set the camera on a tripod a few feet away from the subject (can&#8217;t remember the exposure settings) and snapped a few shots at different adjustment factors. You can search for the details on how this works elsewhere; I just wanted to share the results.

So, there is still some room for improvement, but the increase in sharpness here was enough to appease my wife&#8217;s critical eye.

Now that the lens has been dropped on the pavement, it was time to upgrade&#8230; to the f/1.2 version.

Bottom line: use this feature for every lens that you own. I&#8217;ve also used this feature for the new 50mm and our Tokina 11-16 lens.
